/**
 * 
 * Given the input, write an algorithm that prints a year with the greatest number of people living simultaneously.

Input: Each new line of the input contains a personâ€™s birth and death year. The birth year is in the first position, followed by the death year. The values in these pairs are separated by a comma and then a space. See the sample input for illustration.

Output: Print a year that has the greatest number of people alive simultaneously. (inclusive) If the greatest number of people living in a year is shared by multiple years, print the latest year found.

Sample Input (ASCII format):

1930, 1963
1940, 1967
1950, 1978
1960, 2000

Sample Output:
1963
